**Listicle jQuery List Shuffle Thing**
===

This is a work in progress, you probably don't want to use this 
right now. Just sayin'.

This has nothing to do with Lists and Articles.

Often I've needed to write something that lets a user move
something between two lists. This comes up often in the
Enterprise it seems.

This is a little plugin that provides something that
builds two *ul* things. Clicking on an element in
one list calls an animation function which moves
the thing from one list to the other. Optionally
with a callback to make an AJAX call or something.

That's about it.
